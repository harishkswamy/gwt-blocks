# Summary #
A library that aims at making GWT applications easier to develop.

At the heart of the library is the model framework that implements the [Presentation Model](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html) design pattern and helps bind the views (GWT widgets) to domain models.

Also, there is a view framework which is a thin wrapper around GWT widgets. This is a trivial set of classes and can be easily replaced if you would rather use other widgets in place of the native GWT widgets.
